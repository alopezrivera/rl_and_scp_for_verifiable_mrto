# Abstract

We present the first method capable of photorealistically reconstructing a non-rigidly deforming scene using photos/videos captured casually from mobile phones.

## Introduction

Writing the site for a paper is as easy as writing Markdown. You can include various elements:

- **Lists**:

    - Item 1
    - Item 2

- **Images**:

    ![Sample Image](images/sample.jpg)

- **Code Blocks**:

    ```python
    def hello_world():
        print("Hello, World!")
    ```

- **Citations** with [hugo-cite](https://github.com/kriskristian/hugo-cite):

    {{< cite "10.1145/9999997.9999999" >}}

- **Custom Animations**, **Videos**, **Accordions**, etc.

## Conclusion

This is a minimal example of how to create an academic paper website with Hugo.
